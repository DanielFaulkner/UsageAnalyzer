Logon Recorder (on which UsageAnalyzer is based) Version 0.6:

Records student logons and saves them to an SQL database accessable by a browser.

The computer and user name are collected by 2 scripts which need to be added to the group policy logon/logoff scripts.
logoff.vbs / logon.vbs - Contain 3 variables which can be edited, server location, number of attempts and log file location.

The information is received by a webpage on the server record.php and then saved into an sql database.

The SQL database can be accessed though a front end on the index.php page. This allows searching by user and computer and limited filtering by date.

The remaining files contain functions which shouldn't be accessed directly, except for setup.php which should only be run to create a new database.

Features that may appear in a later version/unfinished:
Setting a maximum database size.
Login page to optionally secure the page and prevent access by unauthorised users.

Todo:
Filter out the domain part of the username and prevent it being entered into the database (or entered in a different field)

Add audit information gathering on request.
Add WEI (benchmark) gathering on request (inc variable to trigger a benchmark or not if not previously run).
Generate utilisation figures by comparing where in the WEI/Usage list each item comes. +/- diff.
