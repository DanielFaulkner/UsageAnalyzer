# UsageAnalyzer
A set of visual basic scripts to report computer and usage statistics to a local server.
An example of using visual basic scripts to interact with a server running PHP and SQL.

Written purely for internal use and experimentation. With the following drawbacks:

Not suitable for use on public facing server (code has not been checked for security holes).
Initial writing was done some time ago, therefore the code will not work without some rewriting to make it compatible with the current PHP/SQL standards.
